ERC721 Smart Contract Implementation
Description
This project is a manual implementation of the ERC721 Non-Fungible Token (NFT) standard using Solidity. It was created for a Blockchain subject assignment to demonstrate how NFT ownership, transfers, and approvals work under the hood without using external libraries.

Features
Standard Implementation: Full compliance with the IERC721 interface.

Core Logic: Implements transferFrom, approve, and setApprovalForAll using raw mappings.

Safety: Includes safeTransferFrom to check if the receiver is a valid contract using extcodesize and the onERC721Received selector.

Testing: Includes a custom mint function to create tokens for testing purposes.

Technical Details
Language: Solidity ^0.8.0

IDE: Remix

Storage: Uses mappings for _owners, _balances, and approvals.

How to Run
Open the files in Remix IDE.

Compile MyNFT.sol.

Deploy using the Remix VM (Cancun) environment.

Mint a token to your address and test the transfer functions.
